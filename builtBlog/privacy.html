<p>This Privacy Policy describes how TidePool, Inc. (“TidePool”) treats the information we collect from users of our services and/or our website (www.tidepool.co).  We will refer to all of our services and our website collectively as “Services.”  This Privacy Policy is subject to the Terms of Service posted on www.tidepool.co&nbsp;(“Site”).</p>
<p>By using our Services, you expressly consent to TidePool&#39;s collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you disagree with anything in this Privacy Policy, you may not use the&nbsp;Services.</p>
<h2>Information We&nbsp;Collect</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automatic Collection.</strong>  Like most web businesses, we may use cookies, pixels, web beacons, and other automated mechanisms to keep track of user interactions with our Services.  We may collect information such as your computer&#39;s <span class="caps">IP</span> address, the type of browser you are using, the websites you visit and the type of things you click on. We may also use third party services such as Google Analytics to gather and analyze user&nbsp;information.</li>
<li><strong>Volunteered.</strong>   If you open an account with us, purchase products or services, send us an email, or share personal information with us in any other way, we collect this information.  The specific types of information we collect depend on what information you choose to provide but may include your name, email address, other contact information, demographic information, and billing information.  You do not have to share this information with us, but without it you may not be able to access certain content, features or Services.  If you open your account via your account with Facebook, LinkedIn or any other third party, we will collect the information that those third parties allow us to collect and use that information in any or all of the ways those third parties&nbsp;allow.</li>
<li><strong>Your Assessment.</strong>   We will not post your assessment on our site in a way that would let users identify you individually.  We may use your assessment and the information you provided as part of the assessment process internally, for any business&nbsp;purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Posted.</strong>  If we provide the ability to post information on public areas of our Site and you post information in such areas that information may be collected and used by anyone, including TidePool.   We strongly recommend that you do not post any information that allows strangers to identify or locate&nbsp;you.</li>
<li><strong>Job Applicants.</strong>  If your personal information is submitted through our website when applying for a job at TidePool, the information will be used solely in connection with your application.  We may retain your personal information for a period of time for the purpose of considering your application for current or future job&nbsp;openings.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How We Use the Information We&nbsp;Collect</h2>
<p>The short answer is that we generally use this information to provide you with better service.  Among other things, the information we collect can enable us&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>customize the content and advertising you&nbsp;see</li>
<li>fulfill your requests for Services and validate your user&nbsp;rights</li>
<li>contact and communicate with&nbsp;you</li>
<li>provide you with additional information we think is of interest to&nbsp;you</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use the information from you and your assessment to continue TidePool&#39;s research into psychological, emotional, and cognitive characteristics, and to improve our Services.   We will only do this in a way that maintains your anonymity.  We may also publish this research in academic journals but we will only publish results anonymously or in the&nbsp;aggregate.</p>
<h2>Sharing&nbsp;Information</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated Information.</strong> We may freely share information we collect by automated means with third parties, such as clients, advertisers, sponsors and business partners, for our benefit and/or for their own&nbsp;use.</li>
<li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> In more limited circumstances, we may give third parties your personally identifiable information (e.g., your name and email address), your assessment and any other information we have collected or you have provided us.  For&nbsp;example:</li>
</ul>
<h2>Children Under&nbsp;18</h2>
<p>The Services are not intended for anyone under age 18. Our Site may include unmonitored content posted by users or sourced from other third parties and such content may be unsuitable for children. We do not knowingly collect or distribute information from or about children under&nbsp;18.</p>
<h2>Third&nbsp;Parties</h2>
<p>If we have ads on the Site or in other Services, or if we use third party analytics services, third parties may collect anonymous user data from our users.  TidePool does not control those companies and this Privacy Policy does not cover how they gather and use such&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>In addition, the Services may contain links to third party websites and content (for example, our Facebook page). TidePool does not control these websites and/or content and these third parties&#39; privacy policies may be different from our own. You access linked websites or third party content at your own&nbsp;risk.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Any information collected by TidePool is stored using standard security procedures and practices that we believe are appropriate to the nature of the information. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and as a result, TidePool cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the&nbsp;Services.</p>
<h2>Foreign&nbsp;Countries</h2>
<p>Your personal information may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your country. If you are located outside of the United States, please be advised that TidePool processes and stores information in the United States and your use of our Services constitutes your consent to and understanding of this&nbsp;processing.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>TidePool reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, and will do so by posting changes to this Privacy Policy on our Site. The new Privacy Policy may apply to current and past users of the Services, as specified in the changed Privacy&nbsp;Policy.</p>
